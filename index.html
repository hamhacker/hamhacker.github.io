<p>Description here: Although Scratch is viewed as simple and basic for most programmers, it has allowed me to grasp various concepts of programming, such as true-false statements, if-else statements, sequencing, iteration, event handling, etc... Another insight through Scratch is that programs will consist of numerous commands - this is probably one of the most challenging aspects of computer science, to look for a missing prompt/execution that causes the program not to work. Eventually, proofreading every single detail revealed the mistake. Although most games include a certain type of AI, tick tac toe proves to be a bit more challenging that it creates more possibilites and provide a human-to-computer interaction. While making this game, I forgot to increase the difficulty so if there was to be be more time I would definitely work on this and fix little glitches within the game.</p>
